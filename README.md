in postman (body-raw-json format) give name and password

if we post(/register) the data enetered in json format will be saved in to your local storage.

get(/register) we can see that data

post(/register1) we can see the hashed password and validate if it is registered or not

post(/login) creates a jwt token for the data

get(/login) gives us the data stored with that jwt token
